### 🛠️ Projects

- **chat.fans** – Write intelligent Notes and chat with your helpers to augment planning and even self-reflection.

- **AutoProbe-MCP** – Minimizing halucination by letting your AI Agent test what it built.

- **mini_autogpt** – tiny AutoGPT PoC which started as a reference for my Book [Unlocking the Power of Auto-GPT and Its Plugins](https://a.co/d/blNi4JO), but then turned into it's own project.
